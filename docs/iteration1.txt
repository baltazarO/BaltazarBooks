Four things I want to do:

1. [E] As a critic, I want to be able to give a review on a book so I can tell others whether I liked it or not.

2. [E] As a viewer, I want to see books and their scores so I can see which ones Baltazar likes.

3. [E] As the website owner, I want links to the Amazon page for these books so viewers can buy the books if they want.

4. [U] As a viewer, I want to click on a book and then go to a page to see its review so I can see Baltazar's full review.

Take the top 1.
